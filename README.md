# web_scraper
My first more complicated program in C# and .NET Framework and this was one which made me really keen on these technologies.

<p>I called it "Web crawler" because this is what I thought it was going to be :D</p>

<p>Later I figured out that it's more like a web scraper getting info from Polish wikipedia, images from the chosen page and HTMLs from subpages of this chosen one (last one is a bit of crawling).</p>
